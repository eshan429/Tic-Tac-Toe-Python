# Tic Tac Toe Python
A basic tic-tac-toe game I created while learning Python

This doesn't use any GUI libraries and uses strings to display the board. The code is really easy and barely 200 lines long so it should be pretty easy to understand.

Feel free to fork this and modify the code at your leisure. If you find any bugs/ineffeciencies with the code/better way of doing things, I'd appreciate if you let me know so that I can leaarn something new!
